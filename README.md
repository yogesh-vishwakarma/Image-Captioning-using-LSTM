# Image Captioning Using LSTM

The goal of this project is to generate some information relevant to the image provided as input. With the help of deep learning combined with image processing, we thought of combining those two and generating some proper output related to that.
## Result
The model generates a suitable caption for the input image with an accuracy of 56.2%
